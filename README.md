# IDO matching decomp

Matching decompilation of the IRIX Development Option compiler.

The intention is to eventually match all the programs required to build C files to an unlinked binary, namely

- `cc` - compiler driver, runs everything else as appropriate
- `cfe` - "C frontend", preprocessor and runs the optimisation and code generation steps
- `uopt` - optimiser used by `-O2`
- `ugen` - code generator used for lower optimisation
- `as1` - assembler for compiler-generated assembly

since this process is the most useful for other decompilation projects.

Lower priority but also of interest:

- `as0` - assembler for handwritten assembly
- `uld` (ucode linker) and `umerge` (procedure merger) for `-O3`
- `ld` (linker) for outputting linked object files
- `upas` frontend for Pascal, possibly of interest since much of IDO is Pascal

Of these,

- `cc`, `cfe` are written in C, `cfe` also contains Yacc components.
- `uopt`, `ugen`, `as1`, `as0`, `uld`, `umerge`, `upas`, are written in Pascal.
- `ld` is unknown at present

## Build dependencies

TODO

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

```bash
make setup
make disasm
make
```
